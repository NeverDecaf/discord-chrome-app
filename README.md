# discord-chrome-app
A chrome packaged app that mimics the desktop client while maintaining the privacy and security of the chrome browser sandbox.

# Installation
1. Download [discord-chrome-app.crx](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/discord-chrome-app/releases/latest/download/discord-chrome-app.crx) from [releases](https://github.com/NeverDecaf/discord-chrome-app/releases)
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/` in your chromium based browser
3. Enable `Developer mode` (toggle/checkbox in top right corner, may vary depending on version)
4. Drag and drop the .crx file onto the `chrome://extensions/` page to install
5. To launch the app visit `chrome://apps/`
6. After lauching you can pin the app to your taskbar (on windows) and it will essentially function as a stand-alone program
### If drag-and-drop install fails, try this workaround:
1. Download the .crx from releases and extract the contents to a folder
2. Visit chrome://extensions/ and turn on developer mode (toggle in top right)
3. Click `Load unpacked` and select the directory you extracted the crx to.
